## The task

At the moment, [CroALa](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/croatiae-auctores-latini-textus) contains 483 documents and about 5.66 million words.

Of the 483 documents, [443](docs/notcroalactsmulti.list) were easy to describe semi-automatically -- via [XQuery scripts](scripts/Scripts.md) -- according to CTS metadata requirements.  The rest (see [a list](docs/croalactsmulti.list)) have multiple authors or other issues.

As we are following the [CapiTainS guidelines](http://capitains.github.io/pages/guidelines) on metadata and directory structure, it has been necessary to rename files in the collection. There is a [concordance file](docs/croalactsconcordance.xml) listing old and new file names.

To learn why we chose to depart from the CapiTainS conventions, and to provide a different interpretation of the CITE Architecture, see the [CroALa CTS explained](CroALa-CTS-explained.md). For an exploration of XPaths number of nodes in CroALa, see [CroALa XPaths](CroALa-XPaths.md).

The task of making this version of CroALa compliant to current CapiTainS setup and conventions is described in [CroALa to CapiTainS](CroALa-CapiTainS.md). Some implications of this task are also sketched there.
